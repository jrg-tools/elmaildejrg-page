## Local development

```sh
$ pnpm i
$ pnpm dev
```

### Environment variables

Copy the `.env.sample` file to `.env` and fill in the required environment variables.

Keep in mind all environment variables with a prefix of `PUBLIC_` will be exposed to the client-side code.

There is a component in `src/components/core/Posthog.astro` that initializes PostHog for analytics. If you want to disable it, set the `PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY` environment variable to an empty string.

## ðŸš€ Deployment

We have a CI/CD pipeline set up with Vercel.
The deployment is triggered automatically on **pushes to the main branch**.
